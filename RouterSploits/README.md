# RouterSploits

As the title most likely implies, this is a collection of miscellaneous router exploitation scripts I have written over the past couple years. I'll update this README with a more detailed list of which routers and versions are included in these scripts, as well as some usage info.

**TODO:**<br />
- Add some usage standardization to the scripts<br />
- Update the README with the vulnerable router model/manufacturer/versions included here<br />
- Add a requirements.txt file for easy dependency installation from pip<br />
