# PyScanner

This tool essentially mimics nmap in the port scanning functionality. By the end I hope to implement most of the basic nmap features (host detection, port detection, service/OS fingerprinting) to utilize in an environment where nmap may not be available. The goal with this project will be to use only the default libraries in Python without needing to rely on any external libraries.
