# PyDump

Creates a simple man-in-the-middle so we can proxy any TCP requests to or from a remote host. This README will be updated with usage instructions and examples once the script is completely finished. It currently supports basic proxying abilities, but both server/port combos are currently hardcoded since I haven't created the argparse setup for this library yet.

TODO:
- Add some sexy hexdumping to the requests
- Set up argparse for the remote host and the listening port
- Refactor code
