# CryptoSeato

CryptoSeato is a small library I made for implementing end-to-end encryption over an arbitrary socket connection. This is still in the testing phase as of right now and isn't fully usable just yet, but if you want to see how it works feel free to check out the scripts (there's a simple walkthrough of the process in CryptHandler.py)
